### What is OpenShift?

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a Kubernetes distribution from Red Hat which provides developer and operational tools on top of Kubernetes. OpenShift Console provides a web-based administrative interface for managing resources in the cluster.

### What are Dynamic Plugins?

 are a new mechanism in OpenShift Console that allows developers to extend the user interface in a dynamic way, meaning plugins can be enabled, disabled, and upgraded without restarting the console.


[Dynamic plugins](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/web_console/dynamic-plugin/overview-dynamic-plugin.html) are an innovative feature in OpenShift Console. With the ability to register plugins at runtime using the ConsolePlugin custom resource, these plugins provide a seamless way to extend the console's interface without the need for restarts.
Key Features

Dynamic plugins offer the following customization possibilities:

- **Add Custom Pages:** Enhance the console with pages tailored to specific use cases.
  
- **Extend Perspectives:** Go beyond the default administrator and developer perspectives.
  
- **Introduce New Navigation Items:** Make navigation more intuitive and tailored to user needs.
  
- **Incorporate Tabs & Actions:** Enhance resource pages with additional tabs and actionable items.
